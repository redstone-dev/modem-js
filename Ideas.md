# Modem.js Playground Ideas
Welcome to the Modem.js Playground! Here, you can mess around with the JS code —— as long as it's in your own fork of this branch.

### Challenges
 - **Use Modem's custom component feature to build a web app with easily reusable JS snippets.** 
***(Coming soon)***	
	This doesn't seem tough at all, until you're ***only allowed to use custom components for all the elements in your app***.  Still, this doesn't mean your imagination can run wild. You ***are*** allowed to create anything, after all.

	> **TIP:** Integrate normal JS with Modem.js for best results.
- **Make custom attributes using the ModemCreate module and assign them to CSS3 animations.**

	A little tricky, but worth it. You might even learn something from this. But here's the catch: you have to do it in 	under 150 lines of JavaScript (not counting the setup code). And you can't minify your code.
	Wow, a huge challenge!

	> **TIP:** Learn CSS before you do this. A handy page for this is [W3Schools.com's CSS Tutorial](https://w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp). Skip what you know already, if you want.
- **Fork the playground branch and make your own module that can interact with Python.**
	For this one, you might need some prior Python knowledge. Anyways, here's the list of things Modem has
	to be able to control to pass the challenge:
	- `print()`;
	- `variableName = input()`; and
	- all `turtle` commands.


Well, that's all the challenges. Pick one, and submit it in the Playground repo as a pull request! See you there!
